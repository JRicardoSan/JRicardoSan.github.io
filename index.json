This has become as result the cornerstone of my research career, making me dedicate my life to working with these amusing systems.\nCurrently I am finishing my PhD studies at the University of Malaga, in the sunny and pleasant south of Spain. These are focused on improving an important kind of algorithms that allow mobile robots go from one place to another: the path planning. I have been working on optimal solutions for autonomous ground vehicles meant to drive through unstructured terrains, which is important for the fields of planetary exploration and search \u0026amp; rescue. My experience includes research stays in the European Research and Technology Center (ESA-ESTEC) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, and the German Center for Research in Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Bremen, Germany. Furthermore, I am also working on solutions to improve the motion planning of mobile manipulators, towards providing them with the capability to reach a site while synchronously deploying a robotic arm.\nI consider the use of smart mobile robotic agents truly benefitial for our society. For this reason, my efforts are directed towards helping to make it real. For instance, these systems will be essential to reach victims of disaster scenarios and assist them, or to explore many more extraterrestrial places to help scientists unveil the secrets of the universe. Besides, I have enormous curiosity about the cognitive processes involved in the human mind and how they can inspire robotic algorithms. My interests and thoughts go hence towards learning more about these algorithms and how can they be applied on mobile robots, in order to make them somehow \u0026lsquo;understand\u0026rsquo; themselves and the world and consequently become flexible and adaptive.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://JRicardoSan.github.io/author/j.-ricardo-sanchez-ibanez/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/j.-ricardo-sanchez-ibanez/","section":"authors","summary":"Since very little I have felt huge passion and astonishment towards machines that \u0026lsquo;think\u0026rsquo; and move by themselves, interacting with the complex and detailed environment our world is.

However, the inherent constraints of space systems make the implementation of complex algorithms an expensive and difficult task. In this paper we propose a control architecture for autonomous navigation. Efficient implementations of autonomous features are built on top of the current ExoMars navigation method, enhancing the safety and traversing capabilities of the rover. These features allow the rover to detect and avoid hazards and perform long traverses by following a roughly safe path planned by operators on ground. The control architecture implementing the proposed navigation mode has been tested during a field test campaign on a planetary analogue terrain. The experiments evaluated the proposed approach, autonomously completing two long traverses while avoiding hazards. The approach only relies on the optical Localization Cameras stereobench, a sensor that is found in all rovers launched so far, and potentially allows for computationally inexpensive long-range autonomous navigation in terrains of medium difficulty.","tags":[],"title":"Efficient Autonomous Navigation for Planetary Rovers with Limited Resources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J Ricardo Sánchez-Ibáñez","Carlos J Pérez-del-Pulgar","Martin Azkarate","Levin Gerdes","Alfonso García Cerezo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572623280,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572623280,"objectID":"0fcf7a71394c5017f2f394ae692a5500","permalink":"https://JRicardoSan.github.io/publication/2019-eaai/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T17:48:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-eaai/","section":"publication","summary":"Autonomy on rovers is desirable in order to extend the traversed distance, and therefore, maximize the number of places visited during the mission. It depends heavily on the information that is available for the traversed surface on other planet. This information may come from the vehicle’s sensors as well as from orbital images. Besides, future exploration missions may consider the use of reconfigurable rovers, which are able to execute multiple locomotion modes to better adapt to different terrains. With these considerations, a path planning algorithm based on the Fast Marching Method is proposed. Environment information coming from different sources is used on a grid formed by two layers. First, the Global Layer with a low resolution, but high extension is used to compute the overall path connecting the rover and the desired goal, using a cost function that takes advantage of the rover locomotion modes. Second, the Local Layer with higher resolution but limited distance is used where the path is dynamically repaired because of obstacle presence. Finally, we show simulation and field test results based on several reconfigurable and non-reconfigurable rover prototypes and a experimental terrain.","tags":[],"title":"Dynamic path planning for reconfigurable rovers using a multi-layered grid","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlos Jesús Pérez del Pulgar Mancebo","Pablo Romeo Manrique","Gonzalo Jesús Paz Delgado","José Ricardo Sánchez Ibáñez","Martin Azkarate"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1563814513,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563814513,"objectID":"662cb09bb107d03558039c4e63cf3cac","permalink":"https://JRicardoSan.github.io/publication/2019-electronics/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T18:55:13+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-electronics/","section":"publication","summary":"The use of autonomous rovers for planetary exploration is crucial to traverse long distances and perform new discoveries on other planets. One of the most important issues is related to the interaction between the rover wheel and terrain, which would help to save energy and even avoid getting entrapped. The use of reconfigurable rovers with different locomotion modes has demonstrated improvement of traction and energy consumption. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to determine the best locomotion mode during the rover traverse, based on simple parameters, which would be obtained from propioceptive sensors. For this purpose, interaction of different terrains have been modelled and analysed with the ExoTeR, a scale prototype rover of the European ExoMars 2020 mission. This rover is able to perform, among others, the wheel walking locomotion mode, which has been demonstrated to improve traction in different situations. Currently, it is difficult to decide the instant time the rover has to switch from this locomotion mode to another. This paper also proposes a novel method to estimate the slip ratio, useful for deciding the best locomotion mode. Finally, results are obtained from an immersive simulation environment. It shows how each locomotion mode is suitable for different terrains and slopes and the proposed method is able to estimate the slip ratio.","tags":[],"title":"Choosing the Best Locomotion Mode in Reconfigurable Rovers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["José Ricardo Sánchez Ibáñez","Gonzalo Jesús Paz Delgado","Pablo Romeo Manrique","Carlos Jesus Perez-del-Pulgar-Mancebo","Martin Azkarate"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1560796440,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560796440,"objectID":"30992ceb3eb4f829db604a242d7b8c03","permalink":"https://JRicardoSan.github.io/publication/2019-astra/","publishdate":"2020-05-27T20:34:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-astra/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper introduces a motion planning strategy aimed at the coordination of a rover and manipulator.
